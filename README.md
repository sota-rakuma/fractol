**fractol**

*Notion*
If your PC is not linux enviroment, you can not see my fracol...
sorry for that. someday I will remake to use any env.

1.make and ./fractol
    you can see what type of fractols are.
    
2. ./fractol param
    you can execute fractol which you like.

If some error happens, tell me.
thanks ;)
